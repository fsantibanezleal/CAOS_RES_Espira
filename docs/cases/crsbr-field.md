# CrSBr, field-driven reversal

Case `crsbr-field` (C11), category C. Real materials. Baked: committed artifacts, replayed by the web app.

Generated from the registry by `scripts/gen_case_docs.py`.

## Why it is in the matrix

The kickoff material and, because of its triaxial anisotropy, the natural host of the biaxial cost-reduction mechanism.

## What a domain expert should see

The optimal pulse cost falls with switching time toward the universal floor; the hard axis pushes the numerical cost below the free-macrospin floor.

## Kill criterion

A biaxial cost above the free-macrospin cost would mean the hard axis is not being exploited, and the material's headline advantage does not exist.

Monolayer, ferromagnetic within a layer, antiferromagnetically stacked in bulk. The exchange Hamiltonian is measured by inelastic neutron scattering (Scheie 2022, S = 3/2), but the anisotropy is below the neutron resolution; the easy-axis scale and the hard-axis ratio used here are assumed and flagged. Triaxiality and its dielectric tunability are computed (Rudenko 2023): the substrate is a knob on the hard axis.

Every value enters through Contract 1 (`data/materials/parameters.csv`); the conversion from the published
unit and each value's note are in that table. Assumed values are not measurements.
